# DS-Lab

This repo contains solution of lab assignments given to me in Data Structure course. All code is freeware and can be used/modified by any organisation weather private/government except terrorist organisations (:p).

Way to compile code.

Assuming you all are linux users, follow these step.

1. Save the code to known directory in your machine.

2. Go to that directory.

3. Open terminal.

4. Search for file which contains "main" substring.

5. compile with following command (gcc main_file.c)

6. run it with ./a.out



All the changes that makes code more authentic and work better are welcomed.
